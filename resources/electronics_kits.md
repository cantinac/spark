Electronics Kits
================

One time-honored way to learn about electronics is the kit. Many of people over the decades had their first encounter with electronics when they were presented with a classic 100-in-1 kit.

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of electronics kits, and today there are hundreds (if not thousands) of systems and individual projects to choose from. From kits that teach the broad basics to complex builds that give insight into unique systems, you'll find just about anything you're looking for out there.

This doc is a collection of some favorites, recent and otherwise. And it's a work in progress. We'll grow this list as Spark grows.

What's out there
----------------

Electronics kits typically follow two paths: teaching a general understanding of electronics or providing the ability to create specific devices. The latter type tends to produce one-off products and are best suited for learning about specicific designs or for creating models. The former are far more interesting, at least for the beginner, as they tend to cover a wide range of electronics projects and experiments, with an eye toward letting users explore as much territory as possible. We'll focus on this type of kit, since they're often a path to teaching a broad understanding of electronics to beginners.

Of the more exploratory sets, there are two general types. First, there's the classic *n-in-1* kits, such as the classic RadioShack Science Fair Electronics Kits.

These little spring-loaded beauties let you created tens or hundreds of electronics experiments by patching circuits together. They're great for learning about all kinds of cool stuff. [Elenco](http://www.elenco.com) makes kits more-or-less like the classic sets, as well as the newer Snap designs.

The other type of basic kit commonly found is more free-form, and is often built around discrete, interconnecting components. Classic systems, such as the incredibly well-designed [Braun Lectron](http://makezine.com/2011/12/08/the-braun-lectron-system-retro-circuit-dominoes/), allowed you to explore by connecting components.

In the intervening years new tinkering-friendly kits have appeared, such as the fairly recent [littleBits](http://littlebits.cc) and the [Cubelets](http://www.modrobotics.com/) modular robotics system.

And that's not all. There are many other kit-type and modular system out there that will help you to explore electornics. And many of there are designed to plug into slightly more maker-oriented systems. For example, the TinkerKit series of components is designed to work standalone or with Arduino and other microcontrollers, bridging the gap between the higher abstraction and ease of use of most kits with the closer-to-the-metal ethos found in microcontroller-driven projects.

Kits for one and all
--------------------

There are kits for all skills levels and ages. Some systems require a bit more skill than others to use, while others are designed to make exploration, experimentation and fun easy and safe.
