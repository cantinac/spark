### You Do It Electronics

http://www.youdoitelectronics.com/
40 Franklin St.
Needham, MA 02494
(781) 449-1005

This place is a classic. And they have more stuff than you'll ever know what to do with. Just go.


### Microcenter

730 Memorial Drive
Cambridge, MA 02139
(617) 234-6400

Microcenter is one of those places that can be awesome, or completely suck. They have all of the traditional computing/networking/printing stuff, digital cameras, some applicances, and various other accersories.

They also have a pretty decent maker/electronics hobbyist area. They carry a selection of items from Sparkfun and other vendors and manufacturers, such as Propeller, Beagle, LittleBits, and Evil Mad Scientist. Sometimes things look a little picked over, but I have been pleasently surprised when I've looked for specific items.

### RadioShack

Various locations

Yep, RadioShack. The original source, the old school hobbyists friend. RadioShack has been around forever, and in recent years, it has moved away from its core mission. But even still, almost every RadioShack still has a selection of basic electrical and electronics tools and a cabinet of basic parts.

And lately, there has some new life in the old mare. RadioShack is trying out a new concept, moving away from their old, dingy store design. And they are once again trying to focus on makers. You can get modern items such as Arduino boards and Bare Conductive paint at many locations these days.

It is worth noting that RadioShack can be a bit pricey for some components. You are likely to get better prices online, but sometime it can be helpful to see and touch an item before you buy it.
